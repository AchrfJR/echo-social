When you create a new sql.Request instance using new sql.Request(pool), 
you are effectively creating a new request object 
that you can use to execute SQL queries or stored procedures against a SQL Server database using the connection pool you've set up.

Breakdown of new sql.Request(pool)

sql.Request Constructor:
The sql.Request constructor initializes a new request object. 
This object represents a single request to the database and provides methods to set parameters, execute queries, and retrieve results.

Connection Pool (pool):
The pool object represents a connection pool to the SQL Server database. 
A connection pool manages multiple connections to the database, allowing you to efficiently reuse connections for multiple requests.

What new sql.Request(pool) Returns:

Instance of sql.Request: The new sql.Request(pool) call returns an instance of the sql.Request class. 
This instance is configured to use the connections provided by the pool.

Using sql.Request
With the sql.Request instance, you can:

Set Parameters: Use request.input() to set parameters for your queries or stored procedures.
Execute Queries: Use methods like request.query() to execute SQL queries and request.execute() to execute stored procedures.
Retrieve Results: After executing a query, you can retrieve results through properties like recordset (for the rows returned by the query), 
rowsAffected (number of rows affected), etc.
