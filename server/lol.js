/*
Certainly! import.meta.url is a feature of ECMAScript modules (ESM) in JavaScript. 
It's part of the module metadata and provides information about the URL of the current module. 
Let’s break down what it is and how it works.

What is import.meta.url?
import.meta: This is an object that contains metadata about the current module.
It is part of the ECMAScript module system and provides information that can be useful for various purposes, 
such as accessing the module's URL or inspecting its environment.

.url: This property of import.meta provides the URL of the current module file. 
It is a string that represents the location of the module as an absolute URL.

Detailed Breakdown
1. What import.meta Contains
The import.meta object is a special object available in ES modules. It holds metadata about the module. For instance:

import.meta.url: Provides the URL of the module file. 
This is useful for resolving file paths and accessing resources relative to the module location.

2. Value of import.meta.url
Type: It’s a string representing the absolute URL of the module.
Format: Typically, it is in the format file:///absolute/path/to/module.js for file URLs, 
or it could be an HTTP or HTTPS URL if the module is loaded from a web server.

3. Usage Examples
Determine the Module's Path

In a Node.js environment, 
import.meta.url might look like file:///Users/user/project/module.js. 
You can convert this URL to a file system path using the fileURLToPath function:

javascript
Copy code
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
Load Resources Relative to the Module

You might want to load a resource or another module relative to the current module’s location. For example, 
to read a file in the same directory:

javascript
Copy code
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from 'url';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { dirname } from 'path';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);

const filePath = new URL('./data.txt', import.meta.url);
const data = await readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
console.log(data);
4. Practical Implications
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Using import.meta.url helps you write code that is portable across different environments where modules may be loaded from various sources (file system, web server, etc.).
Dynamic Path Resolution: It is particularly useful when you need to resolve file paths dynamically based on the location of the module
*/


/*
readFile(filePath, 'utf-8'):

Function: readFile is a function from the Node.js fs/promises module (or fs in a callback-based version). 
It reads the contents of a file.
Parameters:
filePath: This is the path to the file that you want to read. 
It can be an absolute or relative path, and it can be a URL object or a string.

'utf-8': This is the encoding format used to read the file. 
'utf-8' specifies that the file should be read as a UTF-8 encoded text file, 
meaning that the result will be a string. If you omit the encoding, the file is read as a Buffer, which is a raw binary representation.
